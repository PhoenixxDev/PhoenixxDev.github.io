```lua
Bool: utils:CanPerformAction(Model: character, Bool: ignoreMovementAttributes)
-- whether player is able to do a normal action (checks attributes like Attacking, Stunned, Blocking, etc)
```
```lua
Int: utils:getWalkSpeed(Model: character)
-- returns the character's base walkspeed (will determine based on stats/perks/race/etc
```
```lua
void: utils:stun(Model: character, <optional> stunDuration)

```
```lua
void: utils:endStun(Model: character)
```
